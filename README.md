## Weather-Forecast

This project aims to develop a weather forecasting model that predicts various weather parameters based on historical data. Using the dataset (weather_forecast_data.csv) and Jupyter Notebook (WeatherForecast.ipynb), I analyzed trends, preprocess data, and build predictive neural network feed-forward models using TensorFlow and NumPy for accurate weather forecasting.

## Files
 `weather_forecast_data.csv`: The dataset that is used for training and testing the neural network model.
 `WeatherForecast.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that used the dataset to predict and train the model for the test dataset.
 `README.md`: Detailed guide file for the project.

 ## Download the files
 ```rb 
  git clone https://github.com/Raslan5/Weather-Forecast.git
 ```
 ## Requirements
 Install please the following libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `tensorflow`
 ## Usage
 After downloading the required libraries, run the code by opening the Jupyter Notebook in your favorite IDE
 ## Dataset
 The dataset used in this project, weather_forecast_data.csv, contains historical weather data that serves as the foundation  
 for building predictive weather models. This dataset includes various features relevant to weather forecasting.
 ## Features
  - `Temperature`: The temperature recorded in degrees.
  - `Humidity`: The atmospheric humidity percentage, indicating the moisture content in the air.
  - `Wind_Speed`: The speed of the wind.
  - `Cloud_Cover`: The percentage of sky covered by clouds.
  - `Pressure`: The atmospheric pressure.
  - `Rain`: A categorical feature indicating whether there was rain or not.
