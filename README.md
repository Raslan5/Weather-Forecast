## Weather-Forecast

This project aims to develop a weather forecasting model that predicts various weather parameters based on historical data. Using the dataset (weather_forecast_data.csv) and Jupyter Notebook (WeatherForecast.ipynb), I analyzed trends, preprocess data, and build predictive neural network feed-forward models using TensorFlow and NumPy for accurate weather forecasting.

## Files
 `weather_forecast_data.csv`: The dataset that is used for training and testing the neural network model.
 `WeatherForecast.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook that used the dataset to predict and train the model for the test dataset.
 `README.md`: Detailed guide file for the project.

 ## Requirements
 Install please the following libraries:
  `pandas`
  `numpy`
  `scikit-learn`
  `matplotlib`
  `tensorflow`
 ## Usage
 After downloading the required libraries, run the code by opening the Jupyter Notebook in your favorite IDE
